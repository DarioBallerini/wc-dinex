# wc-dinex

wc-dinex is a library of web components. It's intended to serve as practice and also to help me reuse components across my side projects.

The components are published to NPM and the project also has a demo that is bundled using Parcel and deployed using Github Pages.

## Use

 - To start the demo run `npm run start`.
 - To build the demo run `npm run build-demo`
